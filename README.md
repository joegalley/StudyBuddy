This prototype was created for the ATT hackathon. This app demonstrates the concept of assisting students at a University in finding a location to study on campus. This app requires an Android phone with NFC capabilities and smart tags.

A campus needs to have a room or building equipped with tables that have smart tags.

There is a dummy login screen.

After the login the student presented with four options:
	Search for course
	See open tables
	Join table
	Leave table

The purpose of these options if for a student with the StudyBud app to find tables to study at by:
	seeing existing study groups for a given subject
	finding empty tables to start a new study group

Once a student finds the table he may click join table in the App (using the NFC enabled device) which then posts the information and updates the current table participant number at the StuddyBud server.

After studying a student can then leave the table by clicking the leave table button and scanning the smart tag.

This concept is co-owned by the creators. As of Nov 8th, none of us have anticipated continuing this project during our current semester at Pitt, but we have recognized the potential benefits and marketability of this concept.

As of now the all of the project's rights are reserved until such a time that the owners agree upon a new license for the project.
